subHeadline: BuzzingPixel is me, TJ Draper. This is where you'll find my work, add-ons, and more.
content: |
  I write HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to make great websites. I also create great content management experiences and write great add-ons for great CMSes. In short, I enjoy building websites that delight people.

  When I'm not developing software, I'm probably spending time with my 4 children and/or my beautiful wife, watching a movie or TV show, or podcasting.
