      Ansel can crop and resize images on the fly. Doing so is very efficient because the cropped/resized image is cached after the first request for it is made. Any request for that cropped/resized image thereafter comes straight from the cache on disk.

      Cropping/resizing is available to the `{img:url}` variable.
