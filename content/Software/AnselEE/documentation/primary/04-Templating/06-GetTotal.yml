      Sometimes you would like to display the total number of images in a field. Ansel makes this really easy with a parameter on the custom field tag:

  - type: codeblock
    lang: ee
    content: |
      {exp:channel:entries channel="my_channel"}
          {my_ansel_field count="true"}
      {/exp:channel:entries}
